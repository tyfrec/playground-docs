<h3>Something new!</h3>
<div>
At Samsara, we're committed to delivering the best functionality to help you achieve your business goals. We heard your feedback from our v1 API, and we're excited to provide you with the new official Samsara Open API. You can read more about this new API on our [Samsara Open API Release FAQ page](#).</div>
<div>
If you would like to access the existing API docs, you can still do so at this link: [Samara V1 API](https://www.samsara.com/api).</div>
<div>
*Note: This is an API preview, and not a final API spec. Samsara is making this available to outside parties to gather feedback, but we do not recommend coding directly against this API just yet. Samsara reserves the right to make breaking changes until the APIâ€™s full release.*</div>
<div>
*Note: Because this is a still a new set of APIs, we have not transitioned all resources over to this standard quite yet. Resources that still use the V1 standards will be indicated.*

# Overview

Welcome intro goes here.

## Endpoints

All our APIs can be accessed through HTTP requests to URLs like:

```
https://api.samsara.com/<endpoint>
```

<n class="warning">

If the endpoint is still on V1, the URL will be: `https://api.samsara.com/v1/<endpoint>`
